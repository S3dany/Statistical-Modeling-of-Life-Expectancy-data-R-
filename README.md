# Statistical-Modeling-of-Life-Expectancy-data-R-

This project is a comprehensive statistical analysis of running Linear regression of the Life Expectancy (WHO) data set on Kaggle. 

The analysis aims to determine the main predictors of life expectancy based on a number of economic and health factors provided in the dataset. 

I used various techniques and methods to develop a set of comparable linear regression models to decide the main predictors by comparing the number of features and RMSE and adjusted R^2 and meeting the linearity assumptions for each model.

The workflow was carried out in 6 steps as follows:
Cleaning and filtering data - Performing EDA analysis and handling multicollinearity in the features - applying feature selection methods (Best set,  Backward elimination, Forward inclusion) - Run Linear models on each set of features resulting from each phase - Evaluate models based on the previously mentioned metrics.

The following figure illustrates the project's workflow:
